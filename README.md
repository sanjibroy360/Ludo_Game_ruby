# Ludo_Game_ruby

A simple dice game. Only two players can play the game. Firstly players will enter their name and after that he has to just press enter key to roll the dice. Here I've set a target score equals to 100 so the player who will score 100 first will win the game. Like ludo each player will get one extra chance if he/she scores 6 in any turn and if he/she scores 6, 3 times consicutively he/she will not get any point and will also lose his chance. Any player can quit the game any time by just typing "exit".
